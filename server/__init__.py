# This file tells python that server is a package
# NOTE: to generate the SQLite file. Need to:
# $ cd /Camera-Monitor-Network
# $ py
# >>> from server import db
# >>> from server.models import Camera, Image
# >>> db.create_all()
# site.db should now exist in /server
#
# NOTE: db.drop_all() will clear all tables.
# (need db.create_all() to start again)
